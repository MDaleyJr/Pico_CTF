## Problem
Can you handle APKs?

## Solution
Download the apk. Extract the files. 
Open a terminal from the new folder.
I used an educated guess...previous flags have been listed as "flag.txt"
So I ran the find function and it popped up. change directory and cat the file

└─$ find -name flag.txt
./res/color/flag.txt
                                                                                      
┌──(mdaleyjr㉿MLDKali)-[~/Downloads/PicoCTF]
└─$ cd ./res/color                      
                                                                                      
┌──(mdaleyjr㉿MLDKali)-[~/Downloads/PicoCTF/res/color]
└─$ cat flag.txt

Decode that hash for the flag: picoCTF{ax8mC0RU6ve_NX85l4ax8mCl_b112ae57}
