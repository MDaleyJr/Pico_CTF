# Blame Game

## Problem
Someone's commits seems to be preventing the program from working. Who is it?

## Solution
Download the zip and extract it. Open a terminal from the new extracted folder:
do a git log

─$ git log

the list of entries was ridiculously long....but author was the same for as long as I looked.
There might not be too many Authors and thats all we need. so add grep authors to the function and look for
someone new

└─$ git log | grep Author

the intern was at the bottom but since only authors were listd and the intern was the only one different a fast
scroll was easy
