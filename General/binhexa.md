## **Problem**
How well can you perfom basic binary operations? Start searching for the flag here...

## **Solution**
This was a very simple plug and play problem. They supplied 2 random binary numbers and asked you to 
perform +, -, & and | functions. I just used online calculators to complete the actions. After 6 successful
operations a flag was given.
